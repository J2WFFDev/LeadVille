```

## üóÇÔ∏è TABLE STRUCTURE QUERIES

### List All Tables in Runtime Database
```sql
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' ORDER BY name;
```

### Get Table Schema
```sql
PRAGMA table_info(timer_events);
PRAGMA table_info(impacts);
PRAGMA table_info(device_pool);
```

### Row Counts for All Tables
```sql
SELECT 
    name as table_name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM timer_events) as timer_events,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM impacts) as impacts,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sensor_events) as sensor_events
FROM sqlite_master WHERE name = 'timer_events';
```

## üí° USEFUL ONE-LINERS

```bash
# Quick shot count today
sqlite3 db/leadville_runtime.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM timer_events WHERE event_type='SHOT' AND date(ts_ns/1e9, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') = date('now', 'localtime');"

# Last 5 timer events
sqlite3 db/leadville_runtime.db "SELECT datetime(ts_ns/1e9, 'unixepoch', 'localtime'), event_type, current_shot FROM timer_events ORDER BY ts_ns DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Impact count by sensor
sqlite3 db/leadville_runtime.db "SELECT sensor_mac, COUNT(*) FROM impacts GROUP BY sensor_mac;"

# Device pool summary
sqlite3 db/leadville.db "SELECT device_type, COUNT(*), status FROM device_pool GROUP BY device_type, status;"

# Today's shooting summary
sqlite3 db/leadville_runtime.db "SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type='SHOT' THEN 1 END) as shots, COUNT(DISTINCT device_id) as timers, MAX(current_shot) as max_shot FROM timer_events WHERE date(ts_ns/1e9, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') = date('now', 'localtime');"
```
