## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Requirements Defined

### **Bridge-Centric Architecture Confirmed**
Based on detailed requirements gathering, the system architecture is:

**Core Relationship:** `1 Bridge ‚Üí 1 Stage ‚Üí 1 Timer + 5-6 Impact Sensors`

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Bridge Scope**: Each Bridge manages exactly one stage at a time
- **Runtime Assignment**: Operators select which stage each Bridge manages per match
- **Exclusive Ownership**: Sensors connect only to their assigned Bridge
- **Persistence**: Bridge remembers assignments across restarts
- **Scalability**: Design ready for future keystone (master Bridge) architecture

### **Technical Requirements:**
- **Bridge Identity**: Each Bridge has configurable name/ID
- **Stage Assignment**: Runtime assignment interface for operators
- **Sensor Ownership**: Database tracking of Bridge ‚Üí Sensor relationships
- **BLE Priority Logic**: Assigned Bridge wins connection conflicts
- **Match Integration**: Support for Match ID/Name tracking

## üöÄ Next Phase Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Bridge Identity & Configuration (45 min)**
1. **Bridge Configuration System**
   - Add Bridge name/ID settings to configuration
   - Create stage assignment interface in UI
   - Database schema for Bridge identity

2. **Database Schema Updates**
   ```sql
   -- New tables needed
   CREATE TABLE bridges (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       bridge_id VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
       current_stage_id INTEGER,
       match_id VARCHAR(100),
       created_at DATETIME,
       updated_at DATETIME
   );
   
   -- Add to existing sensors table
   ALTER TABLE sensors ADD COLUMN bridge_id INTEGER;
   ```

### **Phase 2: BLE Ownership Logic (60 min)**
3. **Smart Discovery & Connection Logic**
   - Filter sensor discovery to only **this Bridge's assigned stage**
   - Implement exclusive connection logic in device_manager.py
   - Add persistent reconnection on Bridge restart

4. **Stage Setup Interface Enhancement**
   - Display current Bridge identity in UI
   - Filter available sensors to **this Bridge's assignments only**
   - Maintain existing intuitive sensor assignment workflow

### **Phase 3: Testing & Validation (30 min)**
5. **BLE Connection Validation**
   - Test with BT50 sensors assigned to Go Fast stage
   - Verify exclusive connection to assigned Bridge
   - Validate Bridge restart persistence

## üìä Current System Status

### **Working Components:**
- ‚úÖ **Stage Setup Interface**: Fully functional with league/stage selection
- ‚úÖ **Sensor Assignment**: Visual target layout with assignment table
- ‚úÖ **Device Discovery**: BLE device discovery and pairing working
- ‚úÖ **Database Integration**: All stage and sensor data properly stored
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints**: Complete REST API for stage management

### **Identified Issue:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLE Connection Ownership**: Newly assigned BT50 sensors not connecting properly
- **Root Cause**: Current system lacks Bridge-centric ownership logic
- **Impact**: Sensors may attempt connections to wrong Bridge or fail to connect

### **Assigned Sensors (Current State):**
- **Target 1**: WTVB01-BT50-BA:E5 (EA:18:3D:6D:BA:E5) ‚úÖ Assigned
- **Target 2**: WTVB01-BT50-55:50 (C2:1B:DB:F0:55:50) ‚úÖ Assigned  
- **Target 3-5**: Available for assignment with AMG Lab COMM DC1A

## üîÑ Implementation Approach

### **Bridge-Centric Ownership Logic:**
The solution is to implement **Bridge-specific sensor ownership** where:
1. **Each Bridge knows its assigned stage**
2. **Sensors are owned by the Bridge managing their target's stage**
3. **BLE connections are filtered by ownership**
4. **Bridge restart maintains previous assignments**

### **User Experience Maintains Simplicity:**
- **Same Stage Setup interface** (no workflow changes)
- **Bridge identity displayed** but not intrusive
- **Automatic ownership management** behind the scenes
- **Error handling** for assignment conflicts

## üéØ Success Criteria for Next Session

### **Functional Goals:**
- [ ] Bridge can be assigned to a specific stage
- [ ] Only sensors assigned to Bridge's stage attempt connections
- [ ] BT50 sensors connect exclusively to assigned Bridge
- [ ] Bridge restart maintains sensor assignments
- [ ] Stage Setup interface shows Bridge identity

### **Technical Validation:**
- [ ] Database schema supports Bridge ownership
- [ ] BLE discovery filters by Bridge assignment
- [ ] Device manager connects only to owned sensors
- [ ] UI displays Bridge-specific sensor assignments

## üìù Notes for Next Developer

### **Key Insights:**
- **"Match day setup can be a bit of a rodeo"** - Emphasis on robust persistence
- **Balance between safety and ease** - BLE connection logic needs practical approach
- **Future keystone architecture** - Design decisions should support scaling

### **Architecture Document:**
Complete requirements captured in `ARCHITECTURE_REQUIREMENTS.md` with 25 detailed questions and answers covering:
- Bridge scope and assignment patterns
- Timer device roles and functions  
- Impact sensor distribution and ownership
- Multi-Bridge coordination strategies
- BLE connection priority and ownership logic
- Match workflow integration points

### **Current BLE Issue:**
The Bridge service is searching for previously known sensors rather than the newly assigned BT50 sensors. Implementation of Bridge-centric ownership logic should resolve this by ensuring each Bridge only attempts connections to its assigned sensors.

---

**Ready for Implementation:** Architecture is well-defined, requirements are clear, and the foundation is solid for implementing Bridge-centric BLE ownership logic. üöÄ
