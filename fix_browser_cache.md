# Fix Browser Cache Issues

The `Clock is not defined` error is showing because the browser is caching the old version of the TimerDashboardPage.tsx file.

## Solutions (try in order):

### 1. Hard Refresh Browser
- **Chrome/Edge/Firefox:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- This forces the browser to ignore cache and reload all resources

### 2. Clear Site Cache
- **Chrome:** F12 → Network tab → Right-click → "Clear browser cache"
- **Firefox:** F12 → Network tab → Settings gear → "Disable cache" (while dev tools open)

### 3. Restart React Dev Server
If the above doesn't work, the React dev server might need a restart:
```bash
# On the Raspberry Pi (192.168.1.124)
ssh raspberrypi
cd /home/jrwest/projects/LeadVille/frontend
npm run dev
```

### 4. Verify File Changes
The Clock component has been successfully replaced with emoji at line 304:
```tsx
<span className="text-4xl text-gray-400 block mb-3">⏰</span>
```

## Current Status
✅ All Clock references removed from TimerDashboardPage.tsx
✅ All lucide-react imports removed
✅ All icons replaced with emoji equivalents

The error should resolve after clearing browser cache or hard refresh.
