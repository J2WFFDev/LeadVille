# LeadVille Impact Bridge - Development Handoff
**Date**: September 19, 2025  
**Milestone**: v1.0-dev - Bridge-Centric Architecture Implementation  
**Status**: ✅ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED

## Executive Summary

Today marks a significant breakthrough in the LeadVille Impact Bridge system development. We successfully implemented a **Bridge-centric architecture** with **dynamic sensor-to-target mapping**, solving the fundamental scalability limitation that prevented multiple Bridge deployments.

### Key Achievement
🎯 **Bridge-Centric Ownership Model**: Multiple Bridges can now operate independently without MAC address conflicts, with sensors dynamically assigned via database configuration instead of hardcoded values.

## Technical Accomplishments

### 1. Bridge-Centric Database Architecture ✅
- **Bridge Table**: Complete Bridge entity with stage assignments
- **Sensor Ownership**: Sensors linked to specific Bridges via `bridge_id` foreign key
- **Dynamic Loading**: Bridge service loads only its assigned sensors from database
- **Multi-Bridge Support**: Foundation for scaling to multiple Bridge deployments

### 2. Dynamic Sensor-Target Mapping ✅
- **Database-Driven Configuration**: Replaced hardcoded MAC address mappings
- **Real-Time Updates**: Sensor reassignments reflect immediately after service restart
- **Target Label Accuracy**: Impact logs show correct current target assignments

### 3. Enhanced Impact Detection & Logging ✅
- **Dual BT50 Sensor Support**: Both sensors connecting and operating independently
- **Per-Sensor Calibration**: Individual baseline correction for each sensor
- **Enhanced Logging Format**: 
  ```
  💥 Orange-GoFast Bridge | Go Fast | Target 4 | Sensor 55:50 - Time 3.04s, Shot→Impact -0.425s, Peak 153g
  ```
- **Database-Aware Context**: All impact messages include Bridge Name, Stage, Target ID, and Sensor details

### 4. Production-Ready Infrastructure ✅
- **Dual Logging System**: Console and debug logging with proper separation
- **Service Management**: systemd integration with automatic restart
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized config with database path correction
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms for database connectivity

## Critical Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Hardcoded MAC Address Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple Bridges couldn't operate due to hardcoded sensor MAC addresses  
**Solution**: Implemented `get_bridge_assigned_devices()` with database-driven sensor loading  
**Impact**: Enables multi-Bridge deployments and dynamic sensor management

### Issue #2: Static Target Label Caching
**Problem**: Impact logs showed stale target labels after sensor reassignment  
**Solution**: Replaced hardcoded mapping in `get_current_sensor_info()` with real-time database queries  
**Impact**: Target labels now update correctly when sensors are reassigned

### Issue #3: Database Configuration Mismatch
**Problem**: Impact logging connected to wrong database file (db/bridge.db vs leadville.db)  
**Solution**: Updated DatabaseConfig to point to correct database with actual sensor assignments  
**Impact**: All database operations now use consistent data source

### Issue #4: Dual Sensor Connection & Identification
**Problem**: Both sensors reported same Sensor ID due to shared notification handlers  
**Solution**: Implemented individual sensor handlers using closure factory pattern  
**Impact**: Each sensor now properly identified in impact logs

## Current System Status

### Database Configuration
- **Database File**: `leadville.db` (282KB with full sensor assignments)
- **Bridge Entity**: "Orange-GoFast Bridge" (ID: 2) assigned to "Go Fast" stage
- **Sensor Assignments**:
  - `C2:1B:DB:F0:55:50` → Target 4 (was Target 2 - now updates correctly!)
  - `CA:8B:D6:7F:76:5B` → Target 3 (Bridge assignment pending)
  - `60:09:C3:1F:DC:1A` → AMG Timer (Bridge ID: 2)

### Service Status
- **Service**: `leadville-bridge.service` running and stable
- **Connections**: ✅ 2/2 BT50 sensors connected
- **Calibration**: ✅ Per-sensor baseline calibration active
- **Impact Detection**: ✅ Enhanced impact detection initialized
- **Logging**: ✅ Console and debug logs operational

### Frontend Integration
- **Stage Setup UI**: Functional with Bridge filtering
- **Bridge Manager**: Operational for Bridge configuration
- **Console Page**: Real-time impact monitoring
- **Settings Page**: Service management without disruptive popups
