# LeadVille Bridge - Device Pool Migration Handoff
**Date:** September 25, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Migration Successfully Deployed

---

## üéØ **Mission Accomplished**

Successfully migrated the LeadVille Bridge system from legacy direct device assignment to a modern **Device Pool Management System**, providing centralized device sharing, session isolation, and audit trails.

---

## üìã **What Was Completed**

### **1. Device Pool Architecture Implementation**
- **Database Models**: Created comprehensive device pool schema in `src/impact_bridge/database/pool_models.py`
  - `DevicePool` - Shared device inventory with status tracking
  - `ActiveSession` - Bridge session management 
  - `DeviceLease` - Temporary device assignments with connection tracking
  - `DevicePoolEvent` - Full audit log of all device operations

- **API Layer**: Built complete REST API in `src/impact_bridge/pool_api.py`
  - `GET /api/admin/pool/devices` - List available pool devices
  - `POST /api/admin/pool/devices` - Add discovered devices to pool
  - `POST /api/admin/pool/sessions` - Create bridge sessions
  - `POST /api/admin/pool/sessions/{id}/lease` - Lease devices to sessions
  - `POST /api/admin/pool/sessions/{id}/release/{device_id}` - Release devices
  - `GET /api/admin/pool/sessions/{id}/devices` - Get session assignments

### **2. Data Migration Executed**
- **From**: 3 devices (2 sensors, 1 timer) in old direct assignment system
- **To**: Device pool with centralized management
- **Session Created**: "SASP Exclamation Competition" with all devices properly leased
- **Validation**: Confirmed all devices accessible through new API endpoints

### **3. Frontend Integration Complete**
- **File**: `docs/dashboard/unified_bridge_config.html`
- **Enhanced Discovery**: WebSocket real-time BLE discovery now automatically adds devices to pool
- **Session Management**: Creates bridge sessions for device lease tracking
- **Unified Assignment**: Drag-and-drop interface handles both pool and discovered devices
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear distinction between pool devices and newly discovered devices
- **Workflow**: Stage Selection ‚Üí Device Discovery ‚Üí Session Creation ‚Üí Device Leasing ‚Üí Assignment Complete

### **4. Legacy System Deprecation**
- **Backward Compatibility**: All old endpoints still functional with deprecation warnings
- **Deprecation Warnings**: Added to legacy assignment endpoints in `fastapi_backend.py`
  - `/api/admin/devices/{sensor_id}/assign`
  - `/api/admin/devices/{sensor_id}/unassign` 
  - `/api/admin/devices/assignments`
  - `/api/admin/stages/{stage_id}/assign_sensor`
  - `/api/admin/stages/{stage_id}/unassign_sensor`
- **Migration Guidance**: Each deprecated endpoint includes instructions for new Pool API usage

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Device Pool Database Schema**
```sql
-- New tables added to leadville.db
CREATE TABLE device_pool (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    hw_addr VARCHAR(17) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    device_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    label VARCHAR(100),
    vendor VARCHAR(50),
    model VARCHAR(50),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'available',
    battery INTEGER,
    rssi INTEGER,
    last_seen TIMESTAMP,
    notes TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE active_sessions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    session_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    bridge_id INTEGER,
    stage_id INTEGER,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'idle',
    started_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    ended_at TIMESTAMP,
    last_activity TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE device_leases (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    device_id INTEGER REFERENCES device_pool(id),
    session_id INTEGER REFERENCES active_sessions(id),
    target_assignment VARCHAR(50),
    leased_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    released_at TIMESTAMP,
    is_connected BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    connection_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_connection_attempt TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **Migration Flow**
1. **Discovery Phase**: WebSocket BLE scanning finds devices
2. **Pool Registration**: New devices automatically added to shared pool
3. **Session Creation**: Bridge creates named session for device management
4. **Device Leasing**: Drag-and-drop assigns devices via lease API
5. **Assignment Tracking**: All operations logged in device_pool_events table

### **Frontend Architecture**
- **Real-time Discovery**: WebSocket connection streams device discovery progress
- **Pool Integration**: Loads available pool devices alongside live discovery
- **Session Management**: JavaScript creates and manages bridge sessions
- **Device Leasing**: Async API calls handle device assignments via pool system
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators show device source and assignment status
