# LeadVille Impact Bridge - Development Handoff
**Date:** September 27, 2025 - Part 2  
**Session Focus:** Stage Selection API Debug & System Validation  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Stage selection working correctly

## üéØ Issues Resolved Today

### Stage Selection API Investigation
**Problem:** User reported `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` when trying to change stages via dashboard  
**Root Cause:** Issue appeared to be resolved during investigation - API was working correctly  
**Investigation Results:**
- ‚úÖ API endpoint `/api/admin/leagues/1/stages` exists and returns proper JSON
- ‚úÖ Backend server running on `0.0.0.0:8001` (accessible from external connections)
- ‚úÖ Database schema validated: `stage_configs` table properly linked to leagues via `league_id`
- ‚úÖ Network connectivity confirmed from external access
- ‚úÖ 8 stage configurations available for SASP league (Focus, V, Go Fast, etc.)

### Database Architecture Validation
**Discovery:** Two separate stage-related tables serve different purposes:
- `stages` table: Competition-specific stages linked to matches via `match_id`
- `stage_configs` table: Template/configuration stages linked to leagues via `league_id`

**API Endpoint Behavior:** Correctly queries `stage_configs` for league-based stage templates

## üîß System Status Confirmed

### Backend Services
- FastAPI backend: ‚úÖ Running on port 8001
- Health endpoint: ‚úÖ Responding correctly
- All API endpoints: ‚úÖ Accessible from external connections

### Database Tables (22 total)
Key tables confirmed:
- `leagues` (SASP, Steel Challenge)
- `stage_configs` (8 SASP stage templates)
- `bridges`, `sensors`, `device_pool` (device management)
- `bridge_configurations`, `bridge_target_assignments` (current assignments)

### Device Status
- 7 devices paired (1 AMG Timer + 6 BT50 sensors)
- Focus stage configured with 5 sensor assignments
- Device discovery and pairing functional

## üìã Tomorrow's Planned Work

### Device Type Expansion
1. **Add SpecialPit Timers**
   - Extend device type enumeration
   - Add SpecialPit-specific pairing logic
   - Update device display with SpecialPit icons/labels

2. **Add ESP32 Impact Sensors**
   - Implement ESP32 device detection
   - Add impact sensor configuration options
   - Test ESP32 BLE communication protocols

### Data Collection Testing
3. **Bridge Data Collection to Database**
   - Test sensor data flow to `samples` tables
   - Validate impact detection data storage
   - Verify timer data collection and storage

4. **Live Logging Review**
   - Implement real-time sensor data viewing
   - Add shot/impact event logging display
   - Create live data dashboard for monitoring

### UI/UX Improvements
5. **Device Health Status Enhancement**
   - Add battery level indicators with visual status
   - Display signal strength (RSSI) with color coding
   - Show BLE device IDs and connection status
   - Add device name editing functionality

6. **Bridge Configuration**
   - Add bridge name editing capability
   - Improve bridge status display
   - Enhance configuration management interface

### Code Management & Cleanup
7. **Cleanup Phase**
   - Remove unused/duplicate files
   - Consolidate debug scripts into `archive/`
   - Update documentation and README

8. **Pi-to-GitHub Sync**
   - Ensure Pi has authoritative code version
   - Push unique Pi configurations to GitHub
   - Validate all changes are committed properly

## üèÜ Key Achievements

- ‚úÖ Stage selection system validated and working
- ‚úÖ Database architecture fully understood
- ‚úÖ API connectivity confirmed end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Device management system stable with 7 paired devices
- ‚úÖ Bridge configuration management functional

## üîç Lessons Learned

1. **Database Schema Complexity:** Multiple stage tables serve different purposes (templates vs instances)
2. **Network Debugging:** External API testing confirmed server accessibility vs browser issues
3. **System Stability:** Pi Bluetooth services and FastAPI backend running reliably
4. **Frontend Architecture:** JavaScript API_BASE calculation working correctly for cross-machine access

## üìÇ Files Modified/Verified Today

**No file changes required** - issue was investigation-based
- `system_status_dashboard.html` - Confirmed JavaScript API calls working
- `src/impact_bridge/fastapi_backend.py` - Verified API endpoints functional
- Database schema - Confirmed table structures and data integrity

## üöÄ Next Session Setup

**Environment Ready:**
- Pi services running (FastAPI on 8001, Bluetooth stack active)
- 7 devices paired and ready for testing
- Database tables populated with stage configurations
- Development environment stable

**‚ö†Ô∏è Code Synchronization Status:**
- **Pi is the authoritative version** - contains latest working code
- GitHub sync attempted but has merge conflicts in key files:
  - `src/impact_bridge/device_manager.py`
  - `src/impact_bridge/fastapi_backend.py` 
  - `bridge_device_config.json`
- **Recommendation:** Use Pi version for development, resolve conflicts later during cleanup phase

**Priority Order for Tomorrow:**
1. Device type expansion (SpecialPit, ESP32)
2. Database sample collection testing  
3. Live logging implementation
4. UI improvements for device health
5. Code cleanup and Pi sync (resolve GitHub conflicts)

**Development Strategy:**
- Work directly on Pi for tomorrow's session
- Pi has all working fixes and latest device management code
- Sync conflicts can be resolved during cleanup phase

---
**Session Notes:** Debugging session revealed system working correctly - likely browser cache or temporary network issue. All systems validated and ready for expansion work. Pi contains authoritative working version with latest device management and API fixes.
