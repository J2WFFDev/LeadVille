# AMG Commander Enhanced Capabilities Summary

Based on analysis of Denis Zhadan's AmgLabCommander GitHub project and our comprehensive implementation.

## üìã Complete AMG Commander Feature Set

### ‚úÖ **Currently Implemented**

#### **1. Connection & Device Management**
- Enhanced device detection with precise name matching (`AMG LAB COMM*`, `COMMANDER*`)
- BLE connection management with proper service/characteristic discovery
- Connection state monitoring with callbacks
- Automatic reconnection handling

#### **2. Shot Data Analysis (Enhanced)**
```python
# Real-time shot data with enhanced parsing
{
    'time_now': 4.23,      # Current time
    'time_split': 1.15,    # Split time  
    'time_first': 0.87,    # First shot time
    'unknown_field': 2.34, # Additional data field (bytes[10..11])
    'series_batch': 1.0,   # Series/batch info (bytes[12..13])
    'device': '60:09:C3:1F:DC:1A',
    'raw_data': '01 03 00 00 01 07 00 73 00 57 00 ea 00 01'
}
```

#### **3. Timer Control**
- **Remote Start**: `COM START` command to trigger timer beep
- **Sensitivity Control**: Set sensitivity levels 1-10 (`SET SENSITIVITY 05`)
- **Timer State Detection**: Start/stop/waiting events

#### **4. Data Retrieval Commands**
- **Shot Sequence**: `REQ STRING HEX` - Complete shot sequence data
- **Screen Data**: `REQ SCREEN HEX` - Display content and menu state
- Real-time shot notifications during firing

#### **5. Enhanced Screen Data Parsing**
```python
# Screen data structure
{
    'timestamp': datetime.utcnow(),
    'command_type': 2,  # Screen data response
    'data_length': 8,   # Response length
    'raw_data': '02 08 00 73 00 57 00 ea',
    'parsed_fields': {
        'field1': 1.15,   # Potential display value 1
        'field2': 0.87,   # Potential display value 2  
        'field3': 2.34    # Potential display value 3
    }
}
```

#### **6. Battery & Signal Monitoring**
- Battery level reading via standard BLE battery service (when available)
- Signal strength monitoring (RSSI-based)
- Device health status tracking

#### **7. Shot Sequence Management**
- Complete shot sequence tracking with start/clear detection
- Real-time shot additions during strings of fire
- Shot count and timing analysis

### üîç **Protocol Details Discovered**

#### **BLE Characteristics**
- **Service**: `6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e`
- **Write**: `6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` (Commands TO timer)
- **Notify**: `6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` (Data FROM timer)
- **Descriptor**: `00002902-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`

#### **Command Protocol**
| Command | Purpose | Response |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `COM START` | Remote start timer | Timer beeps, fires start sequence |
| `SET SENSITIVITY 05` | Set sensitivity (01-10) | Sensitivity level updated |
| `REQ STRING HEX` | Request shot sequence | Shot data in hex format |
| `REQ SCREEN HEX` | Request screen/display data | Display content data |

#### **Notification Data Format**
```
Byte[0] = Command Type:
  1 = Timer events (start/stop/shot)
  2 = Screen data response  
  10-26 = Shot sequence data

Byte[1] = Sub-type or data length
  For type 1: 5=start, 8=stop, 3=shot data
  For type 10-26: Number of shots in packet

Shot Data (type 1, subtype 3):
  Bytes[4..5] = Current time (centiseconds)
  Bytes[6..7] = Split time (centiseconds) 
  Bytes[8..9] = First shot time (centiseconds)
  Bytes[10..11] = Unknown field (environmental data?)
  Bytes[12..13] = Series/batch information
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Limitations**

#### **1. Random Delay Access**
‚ùå **Cannot read start-to-beep random delay**
- This data is intentionally not exposed via BLE for competition integrity
- Random delay is generated internally and not transmitted

#### **2. Advanced Timer Configuration**  
- Some menu settings may not be accessible via BLE
- Physical button configuration still required for certain features

#### **3. Multi-Timer Coordination**
- No built-in multi-timer synchronization protocol
- Each timer operates independently

### üöÄ **Testing & Validation**

#### **Comprehensive Test Suite**
Run our full test suite to validate all capabilities:

```bash
# Test with specific timer
python3 amg_enhanced_test_comprehensive.py --mac 60:09:C3:1F:DC:1A

# Auto-discover and test
python3 amg_enhanced_test_comprehensive.py

# Debug mode  
python3 amg_enhanced_test_comprehensive.py --debug
```

#### **Test Coverage**
